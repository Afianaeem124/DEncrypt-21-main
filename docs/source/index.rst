**Built for Security and Privacy**
---------------------------------

Developed in Python and Qt, DEncrypt-21 offers cross-platform compatibility (tested on Linux and macOS). Here's how it protects your data:

* **Strong Encryption:** DEncrypt-21 utilizes the Fernet algorithm to ensure the integrity and access control of your data. This robust encryption safeguards your information from unauthorized access.
* **Data Embedding with Steganography:** DEncrypt-21 leverages steganography, a technique for concealing information within images. This allows you to embed confidential data within your images discreetly, making it invisible to the naked eye. The Cryptosteganography module with AES-256 encryption further enhances the security of this embedded data.
* **Open-source Project:**  DEncrypt-21 is an open-source project, fostering transparency and allowing the community to contribute to its development.

**Functionality and Future Enhancements**
-----------------------------------------

**User-Friendly Encryption and Secure Data Embedding**

* **Simple Input:** DEncrypt-21 accepts both text data and images as input, making it easy to use.
* **Robust Protection:** The application employs Fernet encryption for robust data protection, ensuring the confidentiality of your information.
* **Concealed Storage:** DEncrypt-21 embeds encrypted data within images using steganography, providing a secure and discreet way to store your confidential information.
* **User-defined Key:**  DEncrypt-21 requires a user-defined key for both encryption and decryption. This ensures that only authorized users with the key can access your data.

**Future Development:**

* DEncrypt-21 is actively being developed, with plans to include document, PDF, and audio file encryption capabilities in future versions.
* Stay tuned for the estimated Android support release on September 4th, 2024 (placeholder based on your info)!
